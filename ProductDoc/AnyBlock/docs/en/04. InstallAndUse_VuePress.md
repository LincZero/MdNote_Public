The plugin was originally developed at Obsidian, and later I migrated it to Markdown-it, where it can be used by both VuePress/VitePress that supports mdit

How to use:

For the time being, npm has not been packaged and uploaded, and if you want to use it in advance, go directly to my github web project and take out the ABConvertManager folder, and use it as an ordinary mdit plug-in
